+ set sequence1 = 1 2 3 4 1 2 5

Recognizer constructor:
+ set position = 0
+ set sequence = sequence1

loop 1:
  nextInSequence:
-   get position is 0
-   get sequence in position 0, aka 2
    returns 1st value, aka 1
  check(1):
    next is equal to value, so:
+     set position = 1
      return true
loop 2:
  nextInSequence:
-   get position is 1
-   get sequence in position 1, aka 2
    return 2nd value, aka 2
  check(2):
    next is equal to value, so:
+     set position = 2
      return true

loop 7:
  nextInSequence:
-   get position is ?
-   get sequence in position ?, aka ?
    return 2nd value, aka ?
  check(2):
    next is equal to value, so:
+     set position = ?
      return false
